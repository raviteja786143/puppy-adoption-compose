## :scroll: Description
Android app built with Jetpack Compose. This app contains an overview screen that displays a list of dogs, and a detail screen showing each dog's details.

Jetpack Compose is Androidâ€™s modern toolkit for building native UI. It enables you to quickly bring your app to life with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.

This app is build for submitting first week #AndroidDevChallenge.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
Jetpack Compose will ease the implementing animations faster with less code. Check below previews.

App navigation is built with Compose too which eliminates the previous way of using Navigation Component with xml graph. This made development faster also passing args and changing destinations.

Understanding to implement own Theme Shape Typography Color has became bit easier by referring to lot of official jetpack compose samples which are available in GitHub.

Best of all we got to do this in Kotlin way. Excited and long way to go from here.
